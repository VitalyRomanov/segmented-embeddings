# segmented-embeddings

Implementation of morphologocal embeddings for the paper [Evaluation of Morphological Embeddings for English and Russian Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06884.pdf).

Proposed approach uses FastText model, only instead of character n-gram segmentation, words are segmented into morphemes.
